# MALT - Modular Applications, Libraries, and Templates

MALT is a technological ecosystem designed to simplify and accelerate personal application development. Its beating heart resides in the philosophy of modularity: a common foundation of modules, reusable libraries, and configurable templates, which allows creating unique applications leveraging shared processes.

The goal of MALT is to promote a structured yet flexible approach, just like a craft brewery: each "beer" (or application) is different, but shares a significant portion of basic ingredients and techniques. This combination ensures efficiency, consistency, and the opportunity to customize each project according to specific needs.
